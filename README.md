# AlexMIDIDataSet
All of my musical works (~2000 MIDI files) in one nice Data-Set for Music AI Purposes. Please CC BY-NC-SA :) Otherwise, enjoy and have fun! :)

Benefits of using this dataset:

1) Specifically designed for Music AI development/testing/creation.
2) Multi-instrumental with drums
3) Multiple styles and many familiar melodies
4) Free sample analysis/evaluation by myself if you have any problems/questions as I know all of the dataset's compositions by heart :)
5) I do not care if you will plagiarize my work so copyright is not an issue with this set at all.

Description of the Set/Files:

1) AlexMIDIDataSet-CC-BY-NC-SA.zip ORIGINAL DATASET (~430 Multi-Instrumental MIDIs with Drums and Dynamics)
2) AlexMIDIDataSet-CC-BY-NC-SA-Piano-Only.zip Reduction from the ORIGINAL DATASET to Piano Only (~400 Piano MIDIs with Dynamics).

Please note that many of these MIDIs were co-composed with Artificial Intelligence systems/models (MuseNet/AIVA/Magenta) and some of the MIDIs are continuations or harmonizations of well known compositions of other artists. Please excerise care with the resulting models/output and please respect the license terms because we do not want to offend anyone whos work might've been over-fitted or plagiarized by mentioned music AI systems/models.

Huge Thanks and Credits go out to the following people:
