# AlexMIDIDataSet
All of my musical works (~430 MIDI files) in one nice Data-Set for Music AI Purposes. Please CC BY-NC-SA :) Otherwise, enjoy and have fun! :)

Please note that many of these MIDIs were co-composed with Artificial Intelligence systems/models (MuseNet/AIVA/Magenta) and some of the MIDIs are continuations or harmonizations of well known compositions of other artists. Please excerise care with the resulting models/output and please respect the license terms because we do not want to offend anyone whos work might've been over-fitted or plagiarized by mentioned music AI systems/models.
